# ngspice-voltage-divider
So! Let's get started with a simple voltage divider. We have two resistors R1, and R2. We will hook them in series and attach across them some sort of battery. We will then attach a probe between them, and if luck holds out, this should give us a voltage drop of  R1/(R1+R2)
